             writing syntactically correct HTML and CSS to adding javascript to 
             create an interative experience. While building your skills in these topics
             you will create websites that work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and large 
             screen browsers. During the capstone you will develop a professional-quality
             web portfolio demonstrating your growth as a web developer and your knowledge 
             of accessible web design. This will include your ability to design and 
             implement a responsive site that utilizes tools to create a site that is 
             accessible to a wide audience, including those with visual, audial, physical,
